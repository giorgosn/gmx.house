The project is using yarn 2 Zero-Installs feature, <https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs>

done a little fast and dirty, but can be easily improved because of the way <http://aelea.dev> components way of being easily composable

- install NodeJS, <https://nodejs.org/en/>
- `npm install -g yarn` cmd to install yarn package and project manager

> `yarn` has to be used to run scripts(npm will fail) and project managemnt commands

- `yarn dev` runs a development server
